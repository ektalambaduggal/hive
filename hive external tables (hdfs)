1.make sure that you have reloaded the data file in hdfs folder again because while creating internal table through hdfs the data file got cut paste

2. now create external table and also give the location of file till the folder that has file, where table has to point to

   create external table tablename
   (
   dept_id int,
   dept_name string,
   manager_id int,
   salary int
   )
   row format delimited
   fields terminated by ','
   location '/hive_internal_table_hdfs/';
   
3. rest all commands are same
