1. create a folder in the root(/) of hdfs and then copy the department data file into this from lfs

2. use the same old database in hive

3. create a new table in the database in the same way as internal table is created

4. load the table
   
   load data inpath 'path of the file in hdfs' into table tablename;
   
5. now u can see the table information as well as the contents of table as we did earlier in internal table from lfs
